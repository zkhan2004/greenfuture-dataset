The dataset, greenfuture_ideas_dataset.csv, contains information about 3,000 innovation ideas submitted by employees across GreenFutureâ€™s global offices. Each entry includes details such as employee ID, location, department, idea category, submission date, number of votes, collaboration status, approval and implementation status, and any security concerns. To begin analysis, the dataset can be uploaded to a GitHub repository, which acts like an online folder for storing files. From there, the data can be accessed in Google Colab by using its web link, allowing users to load it into a notebook using programming tools like Python or R. .
